This week we're going to be reviewing some of the past 90 days work and seeing how we can affect our balance.

See you tomorrow and may you always find balance in all things!

## Day 92

Check in with where you are at on balance. Some things that can make balance more challenging if your balance is already good (standing on one foot, keeping your eyes closed, moving your eyeballs...)

## Day 93

Review what you know about the feet. What images/movements can help you feel more planted in the ground. How does this affect your balance?

## Day 94 

Review what you know about the pelvis and lower limbs. Can you let your pelvis relax onto the tops of the femur head? Can you find quiet strength your pelvic floor? How does this affect your balance?

## Day 95 

Review what you know about the spine, neck and head. How does this match up with your central axis. How does this affect your balance?

## Day 96 

Constructive rest. Test your balance before constructive rest. During constructive rest, picture yourself challenging your balance to the extreme. Every time you put yourself into difficulty, you relax and let your body settle into a balanced state. From there, every movement you do is effortless and keeping your balance is as simple as breathing. How is your balance affected coming out of constructive rest?

## Day 97 

Spins. Put on socks or shoes that will allow you to spin on one leg. With both legs and both directions, progressively do quarter turns, half turns, whole turns, one and a half turns and two turns. Which directions/legs are easier?

## Day 98 

Spins and relaxation. We are often told that we should add tone to our core for better balance. It works, up to a point. With muscular tone, we can adjust our center of gravity to make up for lack of alignment. We can also restrict our movement so as to "keep" our body on an axis we have place it on. But in doing so, we restrict our body movement, and don't let our body find it's own, relaxed alignment. Compare spins with tone and spins where you are relaxed and in the best alignment you can image.
